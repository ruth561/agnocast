"""Read agnocastlib's per-process tmpfs type announcements.

Each Agnocast process appends `<topic>\\t<type>\\t<role>\\t<node>\\n` lines to
``/dev/shm/agnocast_type_registry/<ipc_ns_inode>/<pid>.txt`` on each
``Publisher<T>`` / ``Subscription<T>`` construction (see
``agnocastlib::internal::TypeRegistryWriter``). The daemon walks the per-NS
directory once per tick and joins the discovered ``(topic, role,
node_name)`` triples with the kmod's endpoint list (which has node_name
but lacks the rosidl type name and the owning pid) so the gossip
publication can carry both pieces of information.

Forward-compatibility rules (parser contract):

* Lines must terminate in ``\\n``. A trailing unterminated tail (writer
  died mid-write) is silently dropped.
* Each line is tab-split. The first four fields are required —
  ``topic``, ``type``, ``role``, ``node_name`` — and any extra fields
  are ignored, so the writer can extend the format additively without
  the daemon needing a lockstep update.
* Lines with fewer than four fields are skipped and a single ``WARN``
  is logged per rebuild (corrupt file or future-incompatible writer).
